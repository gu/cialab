The file that is currently loaded is coreFunctions_17_skip.js which is designated in /var/www/html/cbmarker/index.php (CTRL+F Molly) if need to change.
This is because the cache is not automatically clearing on all computers meaning that the updated code was not loading.
The easiest way to fix this was to rename the file and load that instead of the original. 
coreFunctions should still be the original file. 
The updated code allows for the automatic image loading capability for the percentile project and also eliminates many unnecessary buttons and features for this project type.
